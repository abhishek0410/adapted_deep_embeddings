In this branch following experiment was the performed .

1.) A learning rate of 0.001 was used for the 2 transferred  C.N.N layers . 
2.) Learning rate of 0.005 was used for 1 F.C layers transferred and 1 F.C layer initialised . Further the learning rate by multiplied by 0.1 after 
the 10th epoch and after 30 epochs thereafter .
